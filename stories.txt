Story4
The cracking wooden steps {verb} as they were approaching the abandoned mansion.
As they opened the creaking door and found their way inside,
they noticed it was {adverb} silent inside,
the kind of silence that made the {plural_animals} in
the trees outside scatter like they knew something they didnt.
People had always warned {name} not to come here,
but curiosity got the best of them.
There was something very {adjective1} about the place,
something that didnt sit right at all.

Inside, past the leaning torn wallpaper and the dust covered floor,
an old desk sat where a former {job} once worked.
Nobody knew what happened to them,
just that they had left behind an unfamiliar journal signed simply:
   - {name}.
That didnt help ease tensions.

In the middle of the room, a faded {prefix}-mark glowed on the wall,
pointing toward a locked attic where {number} distinct footsteps were heard.
Against better judgement, they {past_tense_verb} toward the staircase,
gripping the railing tightly.

Halfway up, something quickly brushed past their leg, but they only saw the shadow.
It was shaped almost like a {animal},
something that definitely was not supposed to move.

That was enough.

They backed down slowly, walked right out the front door,
and didnt stop walking until they were miles away.
They never talked about what they saw that night, not that anyone wouldve believed them anyway.
